# Memory-Game
This was my first project as a front-end developer.<br>I have tried to replicate one of our favourite childhood games : The Memory Game.<br>
Rules of this game are pretty simple: the player has to find all the hidden pairs in a certain given number of moves.\

<b>There are 3 levels in this game that I designed: "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard". They differ in number of moves available and number of tiles to be flipped.</b>
